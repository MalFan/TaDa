### Arthur
I like the project, and it's fully packed with ideas. I would recommend you not to go too crazy on features- I'm seeing a bunch of different messaging/commenting/discussion related features. Focus on the most important part of your app: the actual movie database and reviews. Just Movies, Reviews, and Comments should be good enough for the core part of the application. To extend the project, instead of adding irrelevant features like user-to-user messaging, try to explore things like better search and filtering, or integration with social networks. Also, you may find that PostgresSQL is more favorable especially if you are deploying on the class-recommended Heroku platform.

### Salem
This sounds pretty interesting. Are you planning on using any movie API's to get initial data, or provide basic information? Similarly, is there a ticket booking API you have in mind? I know sites like Fandango can provide booking times and purchase links through an API, but I'm not sure you'll be able to facilitate the actual sale of a ticket. Plus, handling money can get a bit hairy. You could potentially maneuver around this by using a service like Stripe or PayPal to facilitate the transfer of funds for you. 

### Shannon
This project is solid, but you have to make sure to work hard on the domain specific features such as movie recommendations and (perhaps) ticket booking. Otherwise, be careful that what you end up creating does not become too similar to Grumblr, but rather has enough features on its own to qualify as technically challenging enough for the final project.
