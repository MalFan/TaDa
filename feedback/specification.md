Project Spec Feedback
=====================

### Product Backlog (9/10)
  * While you've defined all the functions of the app, you don't really talk much about how it's going to be implemented or put together. You should strongly consider enumerating actions that your server will expose, and go into detail about how it will do some asynchronous tasks, like pre-fetching IMDB information. 

### Data Models (10/10)
 * Looks good to me! Everything seems to be represented by a model. Just be sure your movie information maps up well with what IMDB provides you.
 
### Wireframes or Mock-ups (9/10)
  * Overall, well done. Everything seems to be represented, although I'm slightly confused as to whether or not you're going to use a real pop-up window, or something like bootstrap's modal dialog. Additionally, really, really try to stay away from putting things like "list of users" as your view. What user properties are you showing us? How are they laid out on the page?

### Sprint 1 Planning (9/10)

  * Good on you for planning in advanced. However, you should consider separating out work for each individual member. If you don't think the task should be completed by one person alone, it's likely a large enough task to be split up into parts.
